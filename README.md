# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This repository contains an end-to-end **Customer Segmentation** project built with Python.  
It uses clustering techniques to group customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior — enabling businesses to target marketing strategies more effectively.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

**Objective:**  
Segment customers into distinct groups based on:
- Demographics (e.g., age, gender, income, location)
- Purchasing behavior (e.g., frequency, recency, monetary value, product preferences)

**Goal:**  
Identify actionable customer segments to improve marketing campaigns, customer retention, and personalization.

---

## 📊 **Dataset**

The project uses a dataset with the following sample features:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spend-score (1-100)`

*Note:* The dataset can be replaced with your own customer transactional and demographic data.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` – clustering, scaling, evaluation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization
  - `jupyter notebook` – interactive analysis

---

## ⚙️ **Project Workflow**

The complete workflow includes:
1. **Problem Definition** – Understanding the business goal.
2. **Data Collection** – Importing and combining transactional and demographic data.
3. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, outliers.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Creating RFM features and encoding.
5. **Data Preprocessing** – Scaling numerical features.
6. **EDA & Visualization** – Understanding data patterns.
7. **Choosing Clustering Algorithm** – K-Means, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score.
8. **Model Building** – Training the clustering model.
9. **Cluster Profiling** – Analyzing and interpreting clusters.
10. **Visualization** – Plotting clusters in 2D (PCA or t-SNE).
11. **Deployment (Optional)** – Integrate clusters into marketing pipelines or dashboards.

---

## 📈 **Results**

- Identified clear customer segments based on RFM and demographics.
- Visualized cluster separations.
- Provided actionable insights for targeted marketing.

---

## Key Insights:

- Segments identified can be used for personalized marketing campaigns.

- High-value but low-frequency customers can be re-engaged.

- New clusters can be monitored and updated periodically.

## 📢 Future Improvements:

- Use advanced clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, GMM).

- Automate cluster updates with new data.

- Integrate with BI dashboards (e.g., Streamlit, Power BI).

- Test on larger, real-world datasets.
